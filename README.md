# Greq ðŸš€

`greq` is a Rust-based command-line tool for parsing, validating, and executing HTTP-like requests from `.greq` files. Ideal for developers working with raw HTTP interactions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Parse `.greq` request files with structured metadata, body, and evaluation conditions
- Run requests and validate responses
- Supports inheritance, templating, placeholders, and chain of dependencies.
- Works with JSON, status codes, etc.
- Built for performance and flexibility
- Process requests simultaneously

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgchris/greq.git
cd greq
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a single test
cargo run -- test.greq

# Run multiple tests in parallel
cargo run -- auth.greq users.greq posts.greq

# Enable verbose logging
cargo run -- --verbose api-tests.greq
```

### Example Test File

```greq
project: User API Test
is-http: true
timeout: 5000

====

POST /users HTTP/1.1
host: api.example.com
content-type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

====

status-code equals: 201
response-body.json.id exists: true
