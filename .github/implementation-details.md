# Implementation details for AI

Implement the project in Rust language. Make it high quality, readable, understandable and efficient. Use Rust patterns and idioms.

Add tests whenever needed to make sure that all the important parts are robust and bugs free.


Please update cargo.toml with all the necessary libraries at their most up-to-date stable versions.

Use the most common library for logging and store all the detailed logs including the debug lines under AppData/Local (or equivalent in other OSs). The console should show only the important and relevant parts.

Make the console output of the app readable, structured, clear and understandable. add basic colors and display only valuable information. Log when you load base request or dependant request

All the code must be used. Don't add flags that allow keeping unused code.

Add a description above every method, struct or enum.

Make sure the build is successful without errors and warnings. Fix everything until it's compiling successfully.

You have full permissions to use `cargo build` and `cargo test`.

Parts of the app that may be executed in parallel should be executed in parallel.

At some point in the future, there will be extensions to this app. Make sure you write the code accordingly, and it won't require significant refactor once the extensions are added.
